Heya friend, seems you've downloaded this for whatever reason.

To run the file, just run the "run.exe" file in the assets folder. I'd say add a shortcut to that exe to somewhere on the desktop if you intent to use it to prank someone.

To change the stuff that happens here's what you wanna do,

To change the media that plays:
Go to "\assets" repository. Drag the media you want to play (it can be an image, audio, or video) in to the folder. Then, right click the batch file "jar", and select "Edit in Notepad". Once notepad opens, you should be able to see the 7th line which says "start bomb_warning.mp3". Change the "bomb_warning.mp3" with the file that you uploaded (make sure to include file type). Delete "bomb_warning.mp3" from the folder too if you want to.

To change the message that pops up:
Go to "\assets" repository. Then, right click the batch file "message", and select "Edit in Notepad". In the second line, replace the "[your message here]" with... Well, your message.


To change the notification:
Go to "\assets"" repository. Then, right click the batch file "notif", and select "Edit in Notepad". In the second line, replace the "[message title]" and "[message body]" with what you want.
